# Weather-App

This is a weather dashboard app. It has basic functionality of a weather app right now. This is very much a MVP currently. There is no styling yet on this page. Simply enter a city in the search and hit submit. Let the weather app do the rest for you. This website uses mostly JavaScript for all of its functionality. It is pulling all weather information from the API Open Weather.
